### Sales by Subcategory:
- Chairs and phones have consistently had the highest sales of all subcategories.
- All subcategories have had positive growth from 2019 to 2022 except the supplies subcategory.

## Recommendations & Next Steps
- Investigate why sales exhibit a steep dip in January and February, flatline in the middle of the year, and then see a surge in September, November, and December. Are there promotions or discounts we can offer to combat this dip?
- The Eastern region has increased its yearly number of customers similar to other regions, yet it has experienced the least growth in average sales per customer - expand this analysis to understand why. Investigate whether there is an issue with a new competitor in this region.
- Investigate why the supplies subcategory is not experiencing sales growth like all the other subcategories. Is there an issue with the product, competition, pricing, etc.?
